# N215 Repo For Class

## This is the home folder for all my projects

[This is homework two, which is the Travel Fly hero.](https://rydeal.github.io/215-repo/homework/homeworkTwo/travelfly-hero/index.html)

### I made the file heirarchy for the entire Travel Fly website and added some variables.

[This is homework three, which is the completed Travel Fly home page.](https://rydeal.github.io/215-repo/homework/homeworkThree/)

### I added the travel plan cards, the form, and the footer.

[This is homework four, which is making the Travel Fly home page mobile responsive.](https://rydeal.github.io/215-repo/homework/homeworkFour/index.html)

### I added media queries to add a hamburger menu to the navigation and also scale the other elements of the page based on resolution.
